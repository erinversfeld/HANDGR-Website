                <p>Over the last several years, the scene of the hand gesture recognition field has changed due to the emergence of several depth based devices, such as the Myo, the Microsoft Kinect, and the Leap Motion Controller. These devices have been successful in their intended use cases, but sign language recognition provides more of a challenge due to its complexity.</p>
                <p>There currently exists a communication barrier between the Deaf and hearing communities globally. Historically, this difference has produced some discord between the linguistic communities, resulting in the Deaf experiencing a reduced set of social opportunities (REFERENCE: Simms).</p>
                <p>The project aims to explore how to build a tool for teaching South African Sign Language (SASL) to the hearing in South Africa. In particular this study will examine the ability of three gesture recognition devices in conjunction with various machine learning (ML) techniques to identify gestures from the SASL alphabet.</p>
                <p>The results of this study will inform future development of a tool for teaching SASL.</p>

                  <p>Erin completed her B.A. with majors in Computer Science, Psychology and Linguistics in 2016. She was exposed to SASL in the course of her Linguistics studies, but due to the heavy workload accompanying a triple major, was unable to pursue learning this language. As learning languages is one of her favourite past-times, this was somewhat of a struggle to come to terms with. This in combination with her exposure to gesture recognition in her Computer Science studies lead her to the initial inspiration and conceptualisation of this study. She enjoys long walks on the beach and late night conversations. Also cats.</p>
