                    <p>To date, the team has completed their reviews of the literature relevant to their respective devices in the context of South African Sign Language. They are now in the process of completing their project proposal and planning the way forward for the project as a whole.</p>

                    <p>
                    Anna and Erin have both gained access to their devices, and Shaheel is in the process of obtaining his. Anna and Erin are both experimenting with collecting data from their devices. All team members are exploring the use of various machine learning libraries to implement the relevant algorithms.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Additional work</h2>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Remaining questions</h2>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
