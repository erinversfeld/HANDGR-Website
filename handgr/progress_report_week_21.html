                        <p>The team has received the email addresses of all of the current Speech and Audiology students from June Bothma and sent them an email requesting their participation. They have gathered the data for 25 participants thus far. Gestures were demonstrated erroneously to the first 13 participants, and the decision was made to exclude these from the study, but leave them in the data set for the final hand in.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Meeting minutes</h2>
                        <p>
                            A meeting was held on <b>25 August</b> to update the supervisors on the progress being made, as well as to consult with them on how to handle the erroneous data. Assoc. Prof. Deshendran Moodley was unable to attend due to being away. The team agreed to try and hand in at least two drafts for review prior to the deadline for the final hand in.
                        </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Additional work</h2>

                        <p>The team also agreed to submit their proposed rubric for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
