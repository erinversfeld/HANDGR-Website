                            The team members have received feedback on their final drafts for their individual papers. The results of the individual research projects have been finalised. The project's poster has been submitted in anticipation of next week's Open Evening.
                        </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Meeting minutes</h2>
                        <p>
                            A meeting was held on <b>Wednesday, 27 September</b> to receive feedback from both supervisors and discuss the final details of the submission. The following points arose:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The team's writing as a whole received positive feedback.</li>
                                <li>The suggestion was made to include a paragraph linking the three studies in the introduction to each paper, and then a final paragraph comparing their results.</li>
                                <li>The Myo is once again performing poorly. It is unclear which bug picked up on in the refactor caused the massively irregular behaviour experienced previously.</li>
                                <li>Should the database be too big to submit on Vula an alternative arrangement will be made.</li>
                                <li>The team members will finalise their results and send them to each other for comparison by Saturday evening.</li>
                                <li>Assoc. Prof. Gain requested that he receive the draft of the poster for feedback prior to submission.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Additional work</h2>
                        <p>The team members must put the finishing touches to their papers before moving on to document their code.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Next milestone</h2>
                        <p>There are three upcoming milestones:
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Monday, 2 October:</b> The final paper is due.</li>
                                <li><b>Tuesday, 3 October:</b> The final code for the project is due.</li>
                                <li><b>Thursday, 5 October:</b> Poster presentation at the Department's Open Evening.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>                
                    <ul class="pager">
