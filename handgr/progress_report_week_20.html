                            The team has finalised their data procedure, and demonstrated it and their individual classifiers in the feasibility demonstration to Prof. Edwin Blake and Assoc. Prof. James Gain.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The team was able to make contact and meet with June Bothma, the SASL lecturer for the UCT Audiology students. They consulted her on the nature of the project, and she agreed to help them access participants by providing them with the email addresses of her current students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The lack of response from the student body thus far to calls asking for participants prompted the team to form and act on a contingency plan for gathering data. This plan involves recruiting unskilled signers from the student body, giving them some light training by running through the alphabet with them and then recording their performances of the alphabet as would have happened with skilled signers.    
                        </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Meeting minutes</h2>
                        <p>Meetings were held on the 16th and 18th respectively, for the following purposes:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <b>16 August: </b>The team met to do a dry-run of the feasibility demonstration and discuss the upcoming data gathering plan. Everything operated as expected and the team is ready to begin gathering data.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>18 August, 12pm: </b>The team demonstrated the data gathering procedure and their individual software to Prof. Edwin Blake and Assoc. Prof. James Gain. Assoc. Prof. Deshendran Moodley was away and unable to attend. The presentation was received well over-all, with a lot of promise being shown by all of the classifiers.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>18 August, 2pm: </b>The team met with June Bothma, the SASL lecturer for the Audiology students at UCT. Whilst the original intention was for the team to advertise the study to her students directly, her class was shorter than normal and this ended up not being feasible. However, she agreed to forward the class' email addresses to the team. As both a Deaf person and a teacher of SASL she was able to provide the team with very useful feedback on the study's design and intention. The most important of these were that:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>SASL relies on the face and body to convey meaning too, hence this study is limited to a set of its gestures, rather than the language</li>
                                            <li>Even amongst the Deaf you get variation in the style and quality of the signs performed.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                     She also agreed to provide some of her own material for teaching SASL to help with gathering data. This material does not have permission for redistribution and hence is not included here.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Additional work</h2>    
                        <p>The team has begun recruiting unskilled participants from the student body so as to stay on track with their deadlines.</p>
