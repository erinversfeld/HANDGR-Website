                        <p> The team submitted and subsequently received ethical clearance for their data gathering process. They have to submit a revised application by the end of the week as a formality.</p>

                        <p> The deadline for the revised project proposal has been shifted to 14 July to accomodate for the exam period.</p>

                        <p> The team has continued to pilot their data gathering technique. Several issues were run in to and resolved, however, others still remain.
                        </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Meeting minutes</h2>
                        <p>Meetings were held on the 28th and the 29th for the following purposes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b> 28 June: </b> The team met to pilot their data gathering technique again. Issues were discovered with the manner in which the Leap was storing its data. The Leap and Myo were also intermittently disconnecting from the data gathering process. A check-list was devised for the data gathering set up to ensure that all devices are set up correctly and the process is homogenous across participants.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b> 29 June: </b> The team worked remotely on addressing the issues with the Leap and Myo respectively. The Leap's issues were resolved, but the Myo is still proving to be troublesome.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Additional work</h2>
