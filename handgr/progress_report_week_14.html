                            No meetings were held over the course of the vac as not all of the team members were in Cape Town. Additional clearance which had not been anticipated had to be obtained, causing a disruption in the projected data gathering timeline. The relevant clearance was obtained, and its form can be found here.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            The team managed to overcome the Myo's poor behaviour by recording the gestures in sets of ten, and restarting the computer in between sets. This method was preferred over swapping the device out and exploring the combination of the Kinect and the Leap.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Major issues with the data provided by the Kinect were discovered. A work around was devised which required a reworking of the data gathering procedure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The team made contact with both the Disability Centre and the manager of Undergraduate Academic Administration for the Faculty of Health at UCT. Unfortunately neither were able to provide access to students who knew SASL.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, the supervisors were consulted on the best approach for their upcoming software feasibility demo and the best timeline for receiving multiple reviews of their theses.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Additional work</h2>
                       <p>The following deadlines have been set for the next set of deliverables:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <b> 16 August: </b>The revised data gathering tool must be finalised and tested.

                                <li>
                                    <b> 21 August: </b>The team must begin gathering data.

                            </ul>
                        </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Next milestone</h2>
                        <p>
                            The team will give a software feasability demo to Prof. Edwin Blake on 18 August. They will each demonstrate the progress they have made on their own code, as well as the functionality and operation of the data gathering mechanism.
